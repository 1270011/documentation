Welcome to ownCloud
===================
If you are new to ownCloud, then this document is a good place to start. This document describes the core features and architecture of the ownCloud solution at a very high level. As depicted below, this is simply an introduction, that provides the basic knowledge you need before digging into the more complex technical documentation:

Figure1.

There are three roles associated with ownCloud:

* User
* Administrator
* Developer

These roles may be contained in one person, but the document refers to these roles separately to make it easier to understand. The installation can be easily installed for a single user system, and also for a complex enterprise web application implementation. 
You may want to supply all three mentioned as one person, which is yourself. Of course this text refers also to users, that want to have their stuff hosted by a local institution having its own administrator(s) and developer(s)
