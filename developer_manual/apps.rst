Supported App Types
-------------------

ownCloud allows to specify three kind of "types" in the info.xml of a app. The
type doesn't have to be specified if the app doesn't match any of them.

Currently supported "types":

**filesystem**
apps which provides filesystem functionality (e.g. files sharing app)

**authentication**
apps which provided authentication backends

**logging**
apps which implement a logging system
