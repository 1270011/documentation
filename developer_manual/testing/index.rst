The testing team takes care of helping to test and improve different server setups with ownCloud. 

Why do you want to join
-----------------------
There are many different setups and people have different interests. If you want ownCloud to run well on NginX for instance someone has to test this configuration.

Furthermore during bugfixing the ownCloud developers often do not have the possibility to reproduce the bug in a given environment nor they are able confirm that it was fixed. As a member of the testing team you could act as a contact person for a specific area to help developers **fix the bugs you care about**.

Another benefit is a more efficient relationship to the developers: **You know what people are responsible for which parts** and it is easier to get help. 

If you want you will be listed as an active contributor on the `owncloud.org <http://owncloud.org>`_ page.


Who can join
------------
Anyone who is interested in improving the quality on his/her setup and is willing to communicate with developers and other testers.

How do you join
---------------
Simply register on the `testing mailing list <http://mailman.owncloud.org/mailman/listinfo/testing-team>`_ and send an introduction of your personal setup and interests to `testing-team@owncloud.org <testing-team@owncloud.org>`_

You can also join the **#owncloud-testing** channel on **irc.freenode.net** but keep in mind that we may take longer to answer ;)

For further questions or help you can also send a mail to:

* freitag@owncloud.com (IRC: dragotin)
* posselt@owncloud.com (IRC: Raydiation)

What do you do
--------------
You will receive mails from the mailinglist and also from the bugtracker if developers need your help. Also there will be announcements of new releases and preview releases on the mailing list which give you the possibility to test releases early on and help developers to fix them.

We are looking forward to working with you :)
