Junior developer jobs:
* eBook reader app
   Show all the pdf files on a nice overview page ideally with the first page as a thumbnail. The pdf opens with the integrated pdf viewer based on pdf.js for reading. The scanning and indexing of the files should be similar to the Gallery app. Future extension can be downloading of new ebooks from open stores like Project Gutenberg or other repositories and sending of files to ereaders like kindles
* Dolphin Context Menu.
   Integration with filemanagers like dolphin should be possible. Sharing of files with others or access to versioning would be cool
* RSS Catcher App / Syncing with Akregator **Work in progress**
   An rss catcher and reader similar to Google Reader would be a powerful feature. The feeds and read status could be synced with Readers like Akregator
* Podcast Catcher App
   An application that collects podcasts like for example iTunes and provides an embedded player
* HTML 5 Drag/Drop Uploader **Work in progress**
   Enable drag and drop so that users can a drag a file from the local desktop into the ownCloud browser window for uploading.
* ssh client application
   An embedded ssh terminal to access remote servers from within the ownCloud webinterface. ssh.js could be used for that.
* presentation app
   A html5 presentation application for ownCloud using impress.js
* openPhoto integration **Work in progress**
   Currently, openPhoto can only store photos on DropBox or Amazon S3. It was proposed on the mailing list `here(1)`_ and `here(2)`_ to create an openPhoto backend for ownCloud.
