App Tutorial (App Framework)
============================
This tutorial contains the MVC approach to write an app. The benefits of this approach are:

* Highest authentication level and security checks are enforced by default and have to explicitely be turned off
* Possiblity to use Twig templates which escape XSS by default
* Easy to test: The App Framework allows to unittest the whole app by using :doc:`../general/dependencyinjection` 
* Comes with AngularJS JavaScript code
* MVC style

The disadvantages of this approach are:

* App Framework app has to be installed
* Requires to read more documentation
* Possible
