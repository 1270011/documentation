Desktop Synchronisation
========================

For synchronizing files with your desktop computer, we recommend using the
`ownCloud Client`_ for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Its usage is documented
separately in the `ownCloud Desktop Client Manual`_.

Furthermore, It is possible to synchronize your ownCloud calendar and address book
with a variety of different operating systems and devices. It is also possible to
mount your ownCloud storage via WebDAV, which is also documented in the next chapters.
