.. todo:: This section of the manual needs to be revised.

This relies on `MAMP`_, which provides the required environment.

#. Install MAMP and run it.
#. Go to ‘Preferences ? Apache’ and set ‘Document Root’ to
   **/Users/<YOUR USER NAME>/Sites**, so your Sites directory will be
   used as Apache root.
#. Download ownCloud
#. Move it to **~/Sites** and extract it

::

  tar xfpj owncloud-4.5.tar.bz2

5. Now you can set it up by going to http://localhost:8888/owncloud
