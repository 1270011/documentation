.. todo:: This section of the manual needs to be revised.

This relies on `MAMP`_, which provides the required environment.

1. Install MAMP and run it.
2. Go to ‘Preferences ? Apache’ and set ‘Document Root’ to
   ``/Users/<YOUR USER NAME>/Sites``, so your Sites directory will be
   used as Apache root.
3. Download ownCloud
4. Move it to ``~/Sites`` and extract it:
   ``tar xfpj owncloud-4.5.tar.bz2``
5. Now you can set it up by going to http://localhost:8888/owncloud
