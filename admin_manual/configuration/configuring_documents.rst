Configuring the Collaborative Documents App
===========================================

The Documents application supports editing document within ownCloud, without the 
need to launch an external application. The Documents app supports these 
features:

* Cooperative edit, with multiple users editing files simultaneously. 
* Document creation within ownCloud.
* Document upload.
* Secure sharing and editing: Share and edit files securely in the 
  browser, and then share them inside ownCloud or through a public link

Supported file formats are `.odt`, `.doc`, and `.docx`. You must have 
LibreOffice or OpenOffice installed on the ownCloud server.
  
Enabling the Documents App
==========================

Go to your Apps page and click the ``Enable`` button. You also have the option 
to grant access to the Documents apps to selected user groups. By default it is 
available to all groups.
