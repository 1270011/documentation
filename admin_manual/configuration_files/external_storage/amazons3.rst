Amazon S3
=========

All you need to connect your Amazon S3 buckets to ownCloud is your S3 Access 
Key, Secret Key, and your bucket name.

In the ``Folder name`` field enter the folder name that you want to appear on 
your ownCloud ``Files`` page. 

In the ``Access Key`` field enter your S3 Access Key.

In the ``Secret Key`` field enter your S3 Secret Key.

In the ``Bucket`` field enter the name of your S3 bucket you want to share.

In the ``Available for`` field enter the users or groups who have permission to 
access your S3 mount.

The hostname, port, and region of your S3 server are optional; you will need 
to use these for non-Amazon S3-compatible servers.
