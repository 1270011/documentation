WebDAV
======

Use these to mount a directory from any WebDAV server, or another 
ownCloud server.

*   Folder name -- Whatever name you want for your local mountpoint.
*   URL -- The URL of the WebDAV or ownCloud server.
*   Username and password for the remote server
*   Remote Subfolder -- The remote subfolder you want to mount (optional, defaults 
    to ``/``)
*   Secure ``https://`` - Whether to use ``https://`` to connect to the WebDav 
    server instead of ``http://`` (We always recommend ``https://`` for 
    security)
